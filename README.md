# Agent Bazaar Hooks

        **Repo:** `Synthesis-Slice`  
        **Primary track:** Slice  
        **Submission hold:** wait for human approval before registration or live submission.

        An agent storefront that models dynamic pricing, checkout policy, and identity-aware access for ENS and Locus-powered commerce.

        ## Selected concept

        An agent storefront models dynamic pricing, checkout policy, and identity-aware access. The contract stores pricing rule hashes and merchant policy state, while Python scripts assemble hook configurations and buyer flows.

        ## Idea set

        1. ENS + Locus Commerce Store
2. Dynamic Agent Pricing Hooks
3. ERC-8128 Web Auth Checkout

        ## Prize overlap targets

        - PayWithLocus
- ENS
- Lido stETH Treasury
- Virtuals
- ERC-8004 Receipts
- Celo

        ## Tech stack

        Solidity 0.8.24 skeleton, Python 3.13 standard library, JSON manifests, Foundry-style layout, MIT license

        ## Security guardrails

        - principal and spend policies are separated by design
        - whitelist, cap, and cooldown checks gate every action
        - dry-run hashes are recorded before any live execution path
        - compute budgets are explicit and live mode is opt-in
        - secrets are loaded from environment variables only
        - structured logs are appended for every discover-plan-execute-verify step

        ## Autonomy loop

        1. Discover candidate signals and external state.
2. Plan an action bundle with explicit budget, target, and purpose.
3. Run a dry-run check and policy validation before any execution path.
4. Execute only when live mode, wallets, and credentials are supplied.
5. Verify receipts, proofs, and notes, then append structured logs.

        ## Local MVP status

        - [x] README, manifests, and security notes created
        - [x] contract and agent-loop skeletons created
        - [x] local git repository initialized with an initial commit
        - [ ] operator wallet addresses attached
        - [ ] real API keys added through `.env`
        - [ ] live TxIDs recorded
        - [ ] registration and submission executed

        ## Live demo and TxID plan

        1. load real credentials into `.env`
        2. run `python3 scripts/plan_live_demo.py` to print the checklist
        3. replace placeholder wallet fields in `agent.json`
        4. enable `LIVE_MODE=true` for controlled execution
        5. record resulting TxIDs and paste them into `submissions/synthesis.md`

        ## Why this ranks first

        This concept ranks highest because it overlaps PayWithLocus, ENS, Lido stETH Treasury while keeping the
        execution envelope explicit, dry-run-first, and honest about what still needs
        real credentials before anything touches a chain.
